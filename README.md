# Drawing-Tablet-Switcher
A script to toggle the binding of a drawing tablet from one monitor to the other on linux.

The script interacts with bash to recognize your drawing tablet (using xsetwacom), so any drawing tablet should work.

Just clone the script, open your terminal, and . . .

1. 'cd /Drawing-Tablet-Switcher'.
2. 'chmod +x togglescreen status'

Then, however you set up hotkeys on your distro, choose a hotkey and set 'togglescreen' to it. How this is done is dependent a lot upon what distro or wm you are using.
